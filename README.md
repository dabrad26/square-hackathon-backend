## Setup

1. Install PHP on your machine if not already (`brew install php`).
2. Setup the `secrets/photo-wall.txt` file (see `photo-wall.txt.example` for file structure. Be sure to place in `secrets` directory after you create it.).

## Running the server 

You can use the command `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/` to run the server locally.
